/// What this launch actually is, stated before it happens.

/// The dialog's inputs each answer a different question, and the one they add
/// up to — *what will be running, where, on whose account* — was the one thing
/// the old dialog never said. It matters most for the setting that reaches
/// outside this window: a bypass flag turns off an engine's own guardrails on a
/// machine that may not be this one.
///
/// Read-only on purpose, and shaped so: it takes the recessed inset fill, never
/// a field's, so nothing here invites a click.
/// "Not here yet — Harness will fetch it first."
///
/// A download arrow rather than the words, because this state recurs down the
/// engine list and a repeated two-word phrase stops being read. The tooltip
/// carries the meaning for a first encounter; the preflight panel carries the
/// actual command, which is the thing worth reading.
///
/// Drawn in [AppPalette.textFaint] — the ink the row's own qualifiers use. This
/// is a fact about the engine, not a warning about the choice: installing is a
/// normal outcome of picking it, and an amber glyph would say otherwise.
