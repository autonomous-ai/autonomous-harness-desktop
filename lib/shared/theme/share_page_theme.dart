/// The Share Intelligence mockup's own palette and type, to the value.
///
/// Copied from Grid's `shared/theme/share_page_theme.dart`, like the rest of
/// `lib/shared/` — the page it dresses was designed once and now exists in both
/// apps, and a token nudged in one of them is a screenshot that no longer
/// matches the other. Keep the two in step.
///
/// A second palette in one app is a drift risk (§5), and this one is here on
/// purpose: the design for that page is a *cooler* family than [AppPalette] —
/// blue-grey inks at hue 265 where the app runs warm at `#62615B`, a deeper
/// accent, and hairlines several shades darker than the app's 6% black, which
/// on white is nearly invisible. Matching it by nudging [AppPalette] would
/// restyle every screen in the app; matching it here restyles the page that was
/// designed.
///
/// **TODO(BE): four of these inks are under §11's 4.5:1 floor**, measured on
/// this page's own two grounds (`#F9FAFB` rail / `#FDFDFF` card):
