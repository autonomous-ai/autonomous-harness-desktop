/// A square tick box that fills with the accent when it is on.
///
/// Material's [Checkbox] is unusable raw here for the same reason [IconButton]
/// is (see [AppIconButton]): the app defines no `checkboxTheme`, so a bare one
/// takes Material's defaults — and the loudest of those is an **ink overlay
/// that is a circle**, laid over a square box on hover, focus and press. A round
/// wash bleeding out past the corners of the thing it belongs to is the single
/// clearest tell that a control was never looked at; on macOS a checkbox has no
/// hover halo at all, it just deepens.
///
/// It also brings a 48px tap target, a 2px corner where this app's controls sit
/// at 4–8, and a resting rim from `colorScheme.onSurfaceVariant` that reads far
/// darker than any other unfilled surface here.
///
/// So: the app's own formula instead — [MouseRegion] + [AnimatedContainer] on
/// [AppMotion.hover], depth from fill (§1), and a hover state that stays inside
/// the box's own edges.
///
/// ⚠️ This draws the BOX only. The label beside it belongs to the caller, and
/// so does the tap target that covers both — a checkbox whose text is not
/// clickable is a smaller target than it looks, and every row in this app that
/// carries one wraps the pair in its own [GestureDetector].
