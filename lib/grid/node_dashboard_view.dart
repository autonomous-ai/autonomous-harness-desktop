/// **An unreported reading is not a zero, and never sorts like one.** A relay
/// too old to compute the answered rollup sends `null` for every node on the
/// grid, and a node that has served nothing since it came up reports no
/// throughput. Sorting those as `0` would file a machine nobody has measured in
/// among the machines that were measured and found idle — the same libel
/// `node_metrics.dart` exists to prevent, arriving through the back door as an
/// ordering instead of a label. Unmeasured nodes sink to the bottom of every
/// descending sort, as a group, below the real zeros.
