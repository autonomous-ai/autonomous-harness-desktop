// The preflight panel's job is to be right about what the click will do. It has a settled answer
// for "the engine is here", for "it is missing and we will install it" and for "it is missing and
// we cannot" — and it used to have none for "we asked and the machine never told us", which it
// rounded off to "Ready to launch".
//
// That is not a rare corner. A machine on an older Harness CLI does not know `engines_probe`, and
// does not refuse it either — the frame goes out over the relay and nothing ever comes back, so the
// app waits out its 30s timeout and then knows nothing. Meanwhile the panel had already promised a
// launch, and the create failed at the far end with `exec: opencode: not found`.
